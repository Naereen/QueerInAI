## Mission
  While great progress has been made in queer rights, support is still lacking for queer people at many research organizations and institutions. Cultures of de facto don't ask don't tell and ostracism discourage young queer people from joining our exciting and important field and force queer scientists in AI/ML to live painful lies.

  Queer In AI's mission to to make the AI/ML community one that welcomes, supports, and values queer scientists. We accomplish this by building a visible community of queer and ally AI/ML scientists through meetups, poster sessions, mentoring, and other initiatives.

We also recognize the growing impact AI/ML has on people and the potential for these powerful learning and classification technologies to out queer people, in addition to other issues. Therefore, another central part of our mission is raising awareness of these issues in the general community and encouraging and highlighting research on and solutions to these problems.

## Events
We are hosting a workshop at NIPS 2018!

The Queer in AI@NIPS workshop will feature several speakers highlighting the queer experience in AI/ML academia and industry, a panel on the potential of AI/ML to out queer people and solutions to this problem, and a coffee and poster session. In addition, we will have an evening mixer at a nearby venue.
